**Unit 6: Analysis of Simple Flow Geometries (Pipe Flow and Boundary
Layers)** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about the details of two simple flow
geometries which form the basis of much engineering analysis of
practical flow situations.  These geometries are flow in a circular
conduit or pipe and flow near a submerged surface.  Pipes or similar
geometries occur widely in both nature and engineering; consider blood
flow, oil pipelines, steam pipelines, and the internal plumbing of a
building or automobile, for example.  Analysis of flow near submerged
surfaces is important in airfoil design, coating processes, and entrance
flows, amongst other.  An important aspect of both of these flow
situations is whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.*

     Instructions: Please download the PDF file for Lecture Notes of
    ME330: *Elementary Fluid Dynamics* and read pages 141-157.  As
    fluids flow through pipes, they experience a number of losses that
    reduce their velocities.  Losses can occur due to viscous effects
    (think, for example, of friction along the walls of the pipe) or
    flow through bends or valves.  In this reading, you will learn how
    to calculate these losses.

    Bodies”](http://www.engineering.uiowa.edu/~fluids/) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please download the PDF file for Chapter 9 and read
    the entire document.  When fluids flow past an object, they
    experience viscous effects near the surface in an area known as the
    “boundary layer.”  Flow outside of the boundary layer is considered
    to be inviscid, or unaffected by resistance along the object.  We
    need to understand boundary layers in order to analyze lift
    (reactant forces acting perpendicular to the applied force,
    typically pushing an object up) and drag (forces that oppose the
    applied force—think of air resistance). Note that this reading will
    cover the material you need to know for subunits 6.4.1-6.4.7.
