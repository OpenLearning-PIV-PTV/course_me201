**Unit 5: Dimensional Analysis** <span id="5"></span> 
*How does one build a small-scale wind tunnel experiment to determine if
an airplane design on the large scale is practical?  Should one use the
same air speeds for the small plane as for the large plane?  
    
 One could pose many similar questions about how situations change with
size or other scale.  
    
 A related question might be: “How can we combine measured quantities
(e.g. velocity, length, time) to completely characterize a situation?”  
    
 A simple example which you will learn about in detail is
fully-developed flow of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid in a pipe. 
For this case, we need only specify the Reynolds number (fluid density x
fluid velocity x pipe diameter / fluid viscosity) to fully specify the
flow conditions.  
    
 Not only is dimensional analysis useful for designing and analyzing
experiments, it also provides a convenient ways of simplifying the
governing equations and hence simplifies the solution and application of
those equations.  
    
 In this unit, you will learn the fundamentals of dimensional analysis.*

     Instructions: Please download the PDF file for Chapter 7 and read
    pages 15-19.  Engineers often need to create sized-down models of
    their products in order to safely and adequately test them prior to
    production.  For example, an airplane wing may be modeled as a much
    smaller airfoil, placed in a wind chamber, for testing purposes. 
    Therefore, we need to know how to precisely “scale up” the results
    in order to determine how the real product will react.
