**Unit 4: Application of Differential Analysis** <span id="4"></span> 
*Application of differential analysis allows the determination of how
properties such as fluid velocity and pressure vary within a volume of
interest.  For example, we might be interested in the details of fluid
flow within a conduit, through a turbine, or over an airplane wing.  
  
 In those applications, we chose a volume of interest with appropriate
boundary conditions and integrate the governing differential
conservation equations to obtain distributions or profiles of quantities
of interest.  *
