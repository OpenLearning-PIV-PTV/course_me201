**Unit 3: Finite and Differential Control Volume Analysis** <span
id="3"></span> 
*In Unit 2, you learned some fundamental definitions and learned to
apply the conservation of energy (Bernoulli’s equation) to flow
situations.  In Unit 3, you will learn a systematic process for applying
the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy to specific volumes
(control volumes) of interest.  For example, this control volume might
be a section of pipe or a fluid tank.  In addition, we will introduce
the conservation laws over a differential or infinitesimal volume
element in order to obtain differential equations representing the
conservation principles.  You will learn more about the application of
differential analysis in Unit 4. *

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 15 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 3.1: 4 hours

☐    Subunit 3.2: 4 hours

☐    Subunit 3.3: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.4: 3 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Derive the continuity, momentum, and energy equations of fluid
    flows.
-   Use the continuity, momentum, and energy equations to study simple
    flow conditions.
