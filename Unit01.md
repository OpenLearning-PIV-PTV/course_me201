**Unit 1: Introduction to Fluid Statics and Flow Phenomena** <span
id="1"></span> 
*This first unit introduces the basic concepts you will need to know in
order to understand fluids and how they behave.  We will first establish
a working definition of the word “fluid” before examining properties
specific to fluids, including viscosity (a fluid’s resistance to flow)
and compressibility (how a fluid’s volume changes when pressure is
applied to it).*  
                
 *We will then study how fluids act in static, motionless situations.
 One practical application of this study is the understanding of
buoyancy – or to what degree objects sink or float when suspended in a
fluid.*
